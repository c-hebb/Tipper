This Java App was made completely with Java 7 libraries using Swing, all coded via BlueJ to include: the GUI.

I coded this app with the goal to accomplish three things:
  - Involve myself in a Java project in order to improve my programming capabilities.
  - Learn how to create GUIs in Java and understand the code behind it.
  - To create a backbone layout of the first app I plan to pursue in iOS development.
